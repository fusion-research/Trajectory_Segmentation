# Trajectory Segmentation Algorithm
This repo contains the code and sample data for trajectory segmentation approach proposed in [1]. Note that the original implementation of this algorithm is in Java, but we provide a Python Wrapper for convinience. 

## Implementation in Java
Our segmentation solution is implemented in terms of three major parts as follows. 

### Building the Graph

### Trajectory Transformation

### Dynamic-programming based Segmentation

## Python Wrapper
We provide a wrapper on top of the jar files created for different parts of the original Java implementation. 

## Sample Data

## How to Run
