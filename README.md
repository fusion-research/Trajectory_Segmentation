# Trajectory Segmentation Algorithm
This repo contains the code and sample data for trajectory segmentation approach proposed in [1]. 

## Implementation in Java (Performant Version)
This is a the original implementation of our trajectory segmentation solution that is in Java. The code incldues three important classes as follows:


## Implementation in Python
Our segmentation solution is implemented in terms of three major parts as follows. 

* __Building the Graph__

* __Trajectory Transformation__

* __Dynamic-programming based Segmentation__


## Sample Data

## How to Run
